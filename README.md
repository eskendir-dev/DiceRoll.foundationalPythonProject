# DiceRoll.foundationalPythonProject

My foundational Python project: a simple console-based dice roll simulator demonstrating reliable input handling, basic looping, and the standard 'random' module.

## What I've Learned

1. Module Handling (Deeper Dive): Mastered the use of random.randint(A, B) to generate random integers within a specific range (1 to 6, inclusive), correctly distinguishing it from random.choice().. Robust Input 2. 2. Handling: Implemented a while True loop with try...except logic to reliably validate user input, forcing the user to retry if text or non-integers are entered.
3. Loop Control: Successfully utilized the for loop with range(N) to repeat the action (the dice roll) the exact number of times requested by the user.

## How to Run the Script

* Python 3 installed on your machine.
  
1. Download the project file.
   
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
   
3. Execute the script using the following command:
   
``` bash

python DiceRoll.py
